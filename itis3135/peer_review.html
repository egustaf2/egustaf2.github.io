				<li>I like the colors he uses on the page but I feel a though the green backgroud should be a little lighter so you can read the words on the page better</li>
				<li>I like the way that he formatted the page. The border about the textbox looks nice.</li>
				<li>The form on the Contact page looks nice. I think centering it, adding a border around and making the background color of the form would make it pop more on the page</li>
				<li>The slideshoe of pitcre works well. I think adding the arrows closer to the images would be more convinient for the user when scrolling through the pictures</li>
				<li>Overall I think the page looks good so far</li>

			<ul>
				<li>I really like the contrast of the colors that he used the background is light and bright. It is easy to see everything on the page</li>
				<li>I think that the navigation bar could be centered so the page doesnt look so heavy on the left side. I would also recoment removing the underline from the links</li>
				<li>I really like the clients logo but I think it could possibly look nice centered to make the page not look so heavy on the left side</li>
				<li>The photo gallery page looks nice but I think you could add in a slide shoe to filter through the images</li>
				<li>The page also needs validation links and a link to your design company in the footer</li>
				<li>Overall I think that the page looks nice so far</li>
